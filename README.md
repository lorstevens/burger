# burger

This full-stack application uses MySql, Node, Express, and Handlebars.

Users can input the name of a burger they wish to add to the Menu. If they click the "Devour" button, the burger will move to the "Already Eaten" list. If they click on "Not Eaten", the burger will move back to the original list for users to Devour. 

This application stores every burger in MongoDB.
